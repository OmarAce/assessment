# Logic Tree Decisions

- getEmployee method created to return employee's current status in regards to company tree structure, utilized in other functions as helper.
- Utilized hireEmployee to help with initial company tree structure generation

# Improvements

- Currently LowestEmployee method returns current employee argument depth placement in tree, would like function to return lowest employee name regardless of argument

# Merging Similar Functions

- The employee promotion and demotion methods both involve swaping node placements and could probably be merged.
